# Mobile Flashcards - Udacity React Native course final project

This is a Mobile App built using React Native for both IOS and Android devices. The users can create decks and a collection of cards in each deck. In each card, the user enters a question and an answer for that question, saving it to the correspondent deck. 
Whenever he/she wishes to revise the content of a deck, he/she can start that deck's quiz. Each card will show first the question, the user answers it mentally, clicks show answer to check if he/she answered correctly, and then presses the correct button, in case his/her answer was correct or the incorrect button otherwise.
At the end of the quiz the user can see his/her score which is the percentage of questions he/she answered correctly.
